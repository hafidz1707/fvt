This program was written in 100% Matlab Language.

No Package/Plugin required.

To use the program, simply run the following components:
1. FVT
2. notFVT_Raypath
3. FVT_3D

These components are used for Fresnel Volume Tomography Program - Fresnel and must be placed in the same folder:
1. PilihModel & PilihModel3D - (Customizable) A loaded models for forward modelling, can be edited
2. checkSR & checkSR3D - (Uncustomizable) Avoid expanding wavefront outside boundary
3. plottomogram & (Silinder/Slice)3D_M_Model - (Semi-Customizable) a Function to display model, can be edited to customizing the graphic
4. FindGlobalMinimum2 & FindGolbalMinimum3D - (Uncustomizable) A part of expanding wavefront algorithm
5. fdeikonal2Drev3 - (Uncustomizable) A part of expanding wavefront algorithm, Vidale's Finite Difference Travel Time
6. FindWeight & FindWeight3D - (Semi-Customizable) Find fresnel zone based on Watanabe's fresnel volume principle
7. reCheckSR & reCheckSR3D - (Uncustomizable) Similar to checkSR
8. SteepestDescent - (Uncustomizable) Find Raypath
9. FindRaypath - (Uncustomizable) Find Raypath
10. FindNextRatpath - (Uncustomizable) Find Raypath

These components are used for Fresnel Volume Tomography Progrem - Raypath and must be placed in the same folder:
